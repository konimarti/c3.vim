# C3.vim

Syntax highlighting for C3's programming language.

C3 is an evolving language. I try to keep up with the changes.

## Installation

Simply clone the repository into your Vim's package directory or use your Vim
package manager of choice (Pathogen, Plug, etc.).

Note that the package directory is located in `%USERPROFILE%\vimfiles` on Windows,
and `~/.vim` on Unix.
